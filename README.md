[x] Validation as well as prevent clicking the back button
[x] Responsive Web Design

## Admin Portal
The second system is an Admin Portal for the marketing staff to manage souvenir items and for the printing staff to handle print jobs. The features covered in this system are:
[x] Introduce a new souvenir management system
[x] Automate the existing manual A5 hardcopy printing system
[x] Develop an order status monitoring system
[x] Upgrade the existing console application into a web application

## Notification System
Lastly, is the Order Notification system to display the order status for customers. The system allows customers to view the order in two categories, orders that are being processed and orders that are ready to collect. Once the customer has collected his order, the staff will be able to “finish” the order by simply checking a box.
